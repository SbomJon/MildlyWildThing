        <h1>Where the Wild Things Are</h1>
			<p>
				The night Max wore his wolf suit and made mischief<br>of one kind and another<br>his mother called him "WILD THING!"<br>and Max said "I'LL EAT YOU UP!"<br>so he was sent to bed without eating anything.
			</p>
            <!--<span>GFG</span>-->
			
	
			<p>
				That very night in Max's room a forest grew<br>and grew—<br>and grew until his ceiling hung with vines<br>and the walls became the world all around<br>and an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for Max<br>and he sailed off through night and day<br>and in and out of weeks<br>and almost over a year
to where the wild things are.
			</p>
			
		
		
			<p>
And when he came to the place where the wild things are<br>they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth<br>and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws<br>till Max said "BE STILL!"<br>and tamed them with the magic trick<br>of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once<br>and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all<br>and made him king of all wild things.

        <h1 text-align="left">Rain</h1>
			<p>
				There aren't many memories I have from my childhood, but one thing I do know is that I had an obsessive relationship with rain – I still do to some degree. I gave my heart to mother rain and she accepted my offer with open arms.<br><br>

I have some fragments in my memories about my grandmother's house:<br>
I remember silent flashes and the windowsill shaking and creaking after a few Mississippi.<br>
Sometimes one would fall so close that some dried paint from the windowsill would crack and fall onto my hands.<br><br>

There was always a rusty can or an abandoned vase in the garden very well placed so that the drops from the roof could hit it with a soft, intermittent sound; sometimes there was more than one, and the sounds really made a symphony in the garden. <i>Just for me.</i><br><br>

It's also good to remember the cool, soft, wet breeze that kept passing through my body as I watched the rain; Zephyr's kisses are the best and I gave myself completely until the rain stopped or I fell asleep.
